# Hangman remake

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses. Originally a paper-and-pencil game.

This is a recreation of the game in Goloang, which took me aprox. 4 hours to make. 
Rewritten the code a few times to be better.

The program takes a random out of a 10000 word list, and you have to guess letters until you win or lose. 
THen the game stops
